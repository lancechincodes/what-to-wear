## Challenges 💪
Keeping my code organized was a major hurdle because of all of the moving parts in a React project. However, after bucketing my files into folders, it became a lot more managable.

## What's Next 🏁
This project served as an incredible teacher for learning and applying React. In the future, I will continue to refactor my code to make it DRYer via conditional rendering. In additon, I will apply the fundamentals I practiced for this project to bigger and more complex projects.

## Reflection 🙌
This was a really fun personal project! I applied the fundamentals of building a project on React with the component architecture, how to make API calls, and how can I leverage different JavaScript packages like Typewriter Effect. All in all, I hope you enjoyed my project and know exactly what to wear now!
